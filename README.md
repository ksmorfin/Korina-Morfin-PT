# Korina Morfin  -  Personal Trainer

Hello! This is my first project written in HTML, where I learned to use the most common functions of this structural language and became familiar with key elements such as semantic tags, headings, links, lists, forms, and more.

My first professional website as a Personal Trainer.
This project represents the beginning of my digital presence as a NASM-certified coach. The website includes several sections, internal navigation, a contact form, and visual elements that reflect my approach to training, intelligent progress, and personalized guidance.

I’d love to share the result with you, and I invite you to visit my professional website at the following link:

LET'S TRAIN! :) 💪🏻
